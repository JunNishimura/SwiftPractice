# CalculationApp
- this is the pratice of making ios App
- this is calculation game. users will do just calculations. I added 2 levels; one is easy, the other is hard. 
- the content of the game is simple, but I practiced how to make multiple views and their communication each other in this app

## Description
- there are 2 levels. if you type a right answer, you will get "GoodBoy" and you can keep play games. if you type a wrong anaswer, 
you will get the "Try Again!" and move to the page where you can select what you are gonna do next.
